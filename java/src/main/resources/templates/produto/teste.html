            Lyrics:‚Äã
            Workin' on a weekend like usual
            Way off in the deep end like usual
            Niggas swear they‚ÄÖpassed‚ÄÖus, they doin'‚ÄÖtoo much
            Haven't done my taxes, I'm‚ÄÖtoo turnt up
            Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
            Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
            Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
            Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush
